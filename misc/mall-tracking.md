_Mall tracking_ ðŸ›’
# Requirements
## What are we trying to do?
We have a mall with a mesh of CCTVs. We want to track the path people take through the mall. We should be able to specify _filters_ for the characteristics of people whose path data we want to get. Eg: People wearing blue shirts.

## Our assumptions for the system
- Data processing does not happen in real time
- Queries for the data of the last 30 days are allowed

## What kind of queries do we get?  
Some sample queries we might get: <sup>_#1_</sup>  
- Path of people wearing blue shirts
- Path of people wearing shoes
- Average distance covered by people

# Design
## Workflows
**Population and extraction flow:**    
CCTVs have video data. Video is somehow converted into raw data that we can process.  
This raw data is then transformed into something we can query.  
**User querying flow:**  
When we get a query, we try to use the transformed data. If the transformed data does not have the datapoints we need, we trigger the video -> raw data -> transformed data again.  

## Component discussions
Based on this, we can split it into these sections:  
1. Fetching and storing data from CCTV
1. Processing videos to get raw data
1. Transforming and loading raw data to a data store
1. Getting queries from the user
1. Resolving queries with data from the data store

_(todo)_ Incidental features/nice to haves:
- History and results of past queries
- Metrics (data ingestion, queries processed etc)
- Scheduled reports

## Fetching and storing data from CCTV
- Where do we store videos?
- How do we get data from CCTVs to the data store?  

## Processing videos to get raw data
- What does the raw data look like?
- What is the scale of this data?
- How expensive might processing be in terms of time?
- When is data purged?

## Transforming and loading raw data to a data store
- What does the data in the data store look like?
- What is the scale of this data?
- When is data purged?

## Getting queries from the user
- How is it queried, what format?

## Resolving queries with data from the data store
- What happens when data not present in the data store is requested?
- When is data purged?

_<sup>#1</sup> Depends on business requirements (the answer to "why do we need this data?"). Will make some assumptions for now._
