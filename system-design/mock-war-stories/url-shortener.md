# URL Shortener
## What is it?  
Creates aliases for longer URLs that redirect to the original URL when hit.  
Refer: [TinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/app), [Bit.ly](https://bit.ly/)  

## Requirements
### Functional requirements
- Generate short URL
- Short URL should redirect to original URL
- Users should be able to pick a custom URL
- Links will have an expiry time

### Non-functional requirements
- Minimal latency in redirection
- System should be highly available
- Autogenerated links must be non-guessable 

### Miscellaneous
- Analytics
- Should have exposed REST APIs

## Capacity estimation
### Traffic
Assume:  
- 500M shortenings/month
- 100:1 read-write ratio

So,  
URL writes/s = 500M / (30 days * 24 hours * 3600 seconds) = 200 writes/s  
URL reads/s = 200 * 100 = 20k reads/s //100:1 read-write ratio

### Storage
Assume:  
- 500 shortenings/month
- Each URL is stored for 5 years
- Each URL object is 500 bytes (including related metadata)

So,  
Total objects = 500 * 12 months * 5 years = 30B  
Total storage = 300B * 500 bytes = 15 TB

### Bandwidth
For write requests: 200 URLs/s * 500 bytes = 100 KB/s
For read requests: 20k URLs/s * 500 bytes = 10 MB/s
