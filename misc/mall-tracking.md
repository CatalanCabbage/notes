_Mall tracking_ ðŸ›’
# Requirements
## What are we trying to do?
We have a mall with a mesh of CCTVs. We want to track the path people take through the mall. We should be able to specify _filters_ for the characteristics of people whose path data we want to get. Eg: People wearing blue shirts.

## Our assumptions for the system
- Data processing does not happen in real time
- Queries for the data of the last 30 days are allowed
