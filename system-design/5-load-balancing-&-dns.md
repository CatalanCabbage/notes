# Load Balancing
Load balancers 
- Routinely check the health of components
- Distribute heavy traffic load across the components (like servers) running in the cluster
- Reduce the risk of high load on a few machines
- Act as a single point of contact to clients

They can be used to manage traffic directed towards any component.

> In-service instances: Instances (like servers) that are up and running in the cluster  
> Out-of-service instances: Instances that are down
