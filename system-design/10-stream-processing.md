# Stream Processing
With the advent of IoT Internet Of Things, entities are generating and transmitting data online at an unprecedented rate.  
To manage the massive amount of streaming data we need to have sophisticated backend systems in place to gather meaningful information from it and archive/purge not so meaningful data.  

The more data we have, the better our systems evolve. Businesses today rely on data. Hence, stream processing key to businesses and modern software applications.  

## Data Ingestion 
The process of collecting data streaming-in from several different sources and making it ready to be processed by the system.  

There are several layers to the data processing setup:
- Data collection and preparation layer:  
   In order to make the data uniform and fit for processing, it is collected and converted into a standardized format.
- Data processing layer:  
   Further processed based on business logic. Generally classified into different flows, routed to different destinations.
- Data analytics layer:  
   Analytics such as predictive modelling, statistical analytics, text analytics happen in this layer.
- Data visualization layer:  
   Once the analytics are run, we have valuable intel. This is presented before the stakeholders, generally in a dashboard such as Kibana. 
- Data storage layer: Persists data
- Data security layer: Has security systems in place for UAC, etc.
